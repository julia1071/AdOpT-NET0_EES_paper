**How to write a specific capex function for a new technology?**

**How curtailment can be allowed for certain technology?**

There are two types of curtailment: (1) Curtailment of generic production profiles given
in the carrier data :ref:`(see also here under point 4) <workflow_load-data>`. (2) It is
possible to allow for curtailment of renewable technologies modeled as a RES technology type :ref:`(see here) <generic_technologies>`.
In this case, you can specify if curtailment is allowed or not in the respective JSON file.
